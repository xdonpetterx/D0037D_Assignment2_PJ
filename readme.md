#Task 8: Reflection

> What did you learn? What did you kow already?

This lab has taught me that it is a very good idea to use the latest c++
version. I used the 2014 version before and then not all functions 
worked as intended.

> What was difficult in the lab? How did you overcome it?

The search function in Task 6 was really tough to figure out. I was 
lucky enough to find a way to implement it after searching programming 
forums for a long time.  

> How can the lab be improved?

I think that the search function in Task 6 can be clarified, but otherwise
I don't have anything more to add.

> Additionally, write an estimate how many hours you spent on this lab.

Probably around 85 hours.

I'll try to complete the rest of the labs as soon as possible.
